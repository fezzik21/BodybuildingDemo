Demo of a user review app for a gym or bodybuilding site.

These are the things I would do next:

- Text fields may not be long enough to hold their contents
- Layout doesn't optimally use space on an iPad - perhaps a new layout
- There is no visual indicator that more users are loading when scrolling
- When you edit a note on the detail view, the buttons should float up over
  the keyboard
- Visual pass on the pop-ups
- Drop down list for sorting, instead of two buttons
