Demo of a user review app for a gym or bodybuilding site.

Known user-facing issues:
- Text fields may not be long enough to hold their contents
- UI Layout is still wonky on iPhone 4s/5/5s
- There is no visual indicator that more users are loading when scrolling
- Sort buttons don't work (issues on the back end?)
- Need better app icons, visual/design pass
- When you edit a note on the detail view, the buttons should float up over
  the keyboard

Known code issues:
- Very little bulletproofing; bad data could easily cause a crash
- Some duplication of effort (e.g. calculating age from birthday)
- Use enums instead of defines
